<h1>Music Experience</h1>
                        <h3>Beginnings</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love of music started when I was just a little boy.  My dad
                        played guitar since I can remember, and it always sounded so beautiful...
                        at least when he would actually finish a song.  I gravitated toward
                        the music of Louis Armstrong and by age 10 I was already given a play trumpet.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Middle School I joined the band and picked up a real trumpet and took to it
                        really fast.  I joined out school jazz band and played solos there and
                        learned as much as I could.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During High School i gained a reputation in my band classes and amoung 
                        friends as being somewhat of a music man.  I got into two international 
                        Jazz bands, one hosted in Brussels, Belgium in 2006 and the other hosted in Tokyo, Japan 
                        in 2007.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also during this time is when I started to write music.  The first track on the left was the 
                        first song that i collaborated on, and eventually adapted to be my own.  Pink Ribbon 
                        was my most popular song among the songs I wrote and it's what started my branching out into other
                        instruments. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first instrument I branched out to was vocals, which I had
                            practiced before only in the shower.  I started there and joined the choir my senior year
                            making it into our Madrigal group off the bat.  I then went to learning and playing the guitar
                            because the guitarists I had all moved away, so out of necessity i learned.
                            I also learned piano in order to better write chords for music and understand more
                            music theory. A showcase of some of my work can be seen on either side, from the tracks I recorded on
                            my laptop (on the left), or to the videos I have posted on YouTube</p
