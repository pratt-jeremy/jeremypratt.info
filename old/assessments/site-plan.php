                <p>Jesse is a 4 time Iron Man participant.  He started doing events when
                he was only 14 years old.  Currently he is 24 and does events as often as he can,
                as he is kept busy as a personal trainer.  Often he'll have a trainee 
                join him at an event, but he's looking to this event as a personal event.
                his motto is, "Only stop when you die".</p>
