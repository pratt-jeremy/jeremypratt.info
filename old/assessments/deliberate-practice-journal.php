            <h3>Lesson 02</h3>
            <p>"Time spent in practice that week.
            i only spent about 2 and a half hours practicing.  mainly editing and changing my site and trying to edit the files and style of the site.  
            The topic(s) that you focused on for your practice. 
            I focused on HTML5 programming.  Figuring out how to better space paragaphs and sentences to appear better on a mobile site.  
            An example of what you produced as a result of your practice. The example can be a part of the entry itself or a link to a proof that you produced as part of your practice. All examples should be web-based files (HTML pages, CSS documents attached to web pages, etc). 
            i played around with which size of heading would work best sperating the different parts of the plan, as well as spacing of paragraphs.

            <h3>Lesson 03</h3>
            <p>I spent only 2 hours working on the site.  I haven't implemented my practice plan as i outlined yet, programming from scratch a new page, but i am programming in all the languages i have learned.  Once we move into the house, i think it will be easier because there will be a dedicated space. So far i've just done only basic editing to the site.  i'm writing the site plan and getting it ready to post to the site so i'm exited for that. it should be ready by tomorrow.</p>
            <h3>Lesson 04</h3>
            <p>
            I spent 2 and a half hours. i focused on creating the deliberate practice Journal page because i was unsure if we needed it already so i worked on adding it to the site and verifying that eveything would work/

            </p>
            <h3>Lesson 05</h3>
            <p>I spent around 3 hours, maybe more working on adding more buttons and 
            pages to my site</p> 
            <p>I focused mainly on creating more content for my site because i feel like if i don't create
            the content now, then later on when we're doing the styling i'm going to have a lot of content to
            write up in a short time.</p>
            <p>The links in the navigation can take you to what i've done so far but here they are again.  i added
            these to the navigation on all of my pages as well so you can get to them from every page.</p>

            <h3>Lesson 6</h3>
            <p>for my deliberate practice i was working on collecting the bulk content for my website.  Unfortunately i've been reimaging and reimaging my computer over and over because it keeps going crazy, so a lot of my content is now gone.  i'm sure it's on my dropbox somewhere, but i had it all in folders on my computer, but when it crashed i lost that.  I'm now downloading everything i can, all the videos i took of me playing and dancing, as well as audio tracks and photos.  It's taking a while to get it.  Is there any way of referencing content on dropbox without having to download it and add it to the folder which the site pulls from?
i wish i could show an example, but i haven't compiled the information yet.  I understand getting docked for that and that's okay.</p>
            <h3>Lesson 7</h3>
            <p>I spent my time, a whole 4 and half hours completing my site with picture
            audio, and video content.  I worked on making sure it was all in HTML format and that
            all the content was in the web based folders so it wasn't referencing folders or images
            on my computer.  so far it looks as though everything is running smoothly, but we'll see if that
            continues here on out.
            for an example of the work just go through my site and check it all out.</p>
            <h3>Lesson 8</h3>
            <p>http://jeremypratt.info/stylesheet.php is the example of my work
 
I spent 3 hours trying out differetn fonts and sizes.  i wish i would've paid more attention to sizing because right now it's really wrong.  I'm trying to make it so the header with the navigation is set to the top.  the title of the site is aligned to the top left and the navigation links are top right.  I'll need to play around a bit more, but i'm just trying mulitple tests.
I'll reach out more to my peers to figure things out and try things out.
            </p>
            <h3>Lesson 9</h3>
            <p>
            i spent about 3 and a half hours working on the style sheet and 
            getting my content to position where i wanted.
            i focused mainly on getting the site to be styled the way i like.  
            i'm thinking i'm going to need to edit the site plan, because the 
            colors i chose aren't coming out as i thought they would.  the blue 
            was too blue, and having white font on a blue background works 
            better than black. I figured out how to hange the text color of the 
            navigation wh9ich was a huge help.
            An example of what i did is found at: 
            http://jeremypratt.info/stylesheet.php
            i copied my experience page to the stylesheet i have so i could see 
            how that page would turn out.  it looks ok, but right now i'm trying
            to figure out how to get the div to fill in the bottom, without 
            specifying by pixels.  i prefer using percentage, but it just goes 
            around the text.  It's most likely done through the wrapper, but 
            i'll need to play a bit more.
            </p>
            <h3>Lesson 10</h3>
            <p>i spent 3 hours and 10 minutes on my website. I chose to work on my forms and styling sheet. An
            Example of what i did can be seen at:  http://jeremypratt.info/Contact/contact.php
            as well as applying my stlying to the whole website.  i still need to implement the 3 column design to the rest of the website, but that's for another week.
            </p>
            <h3>Lesson 11</h3>
            <p>I spent 3 hours on the website.
            I spent that time finalizing the style sheet, making it external and linking it to my website.  I added more media queries and then edited the divs on my pages to make sure they held the classes necessary from my CSS to be implemented correctly.  I also went through the testing and my site is rather slow.  I worked on that a little but started to run out of time so I stopped.
