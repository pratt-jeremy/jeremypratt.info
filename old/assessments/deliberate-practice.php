<h2>Deliberate Practice Plan</h2>
            <h4>Where:</h4> 
            <p>Well this will change here in a month; however, I will be doing my practices at our dining room table,
            until we move into our house, then they will be done in the dedicated office space.  The space in the 
            house has a door so that it blocks out distractions so practices can be more focused. Also it was the 
            place of a former business of ours so it has that work environment to help with the process.</p>
            <h4>When:</h4>
            <p>Usually Mornings I have time because I work part time in the afternoon.  So mornings is best, and to 
            keep it condensed to facilitate other work I’ll reserve Tuesday and Thursday mornings for the practices.</p> 
            <h4>How:</h4>
            <p>Instead of saying the amount of time, I’ll say that having successfully completed 5 attempts without prompts,
            it’ll be enough. I think that as the course progresses this will most likely take 1 to 1 and a half hours.</p> 
            <h4>Who:</h4>
            <p>My wife is a Programmer at USAA and graduated with a degree in IT from BYUI and I will have her check my work
            and give me feedback on current best practices for the IT industry.  She can also determine what I would be 
            doing wrong with the programs and help me troubleshoot what I’m missing.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>(Idea for how I will practice)</h4>
            <p>I will write the basic parts of an HTML document to start with in notepad ++.  As I start to progress to that
            being easy I will then move onto to adding Java Script input text boxes to the document.  As that becomes easier
            to do without prompts and as I Learn about PHP and CSS I will then start writing the necessary components of a 
            PHP document.  As I learn CSS I will apply the CSS to the documents I make each time adding in the different things
            I learn so that I practice everything.  I will write the documents and if they open as I expect in an internet 
            browser, then I will delete it and try again.  After 5 successful attempts I will be done.  As I learn more it’ll
            be 1 successful try per part learned (ie: HTML, PHP, CSS, Java Script, etc.).</p>
