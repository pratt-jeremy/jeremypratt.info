<h1>WELCOME!!!</h1>
<p>San Quentin prison is a maximum security California state prison near San Rafael. 
    Alcatraz Prison was a maximum-security federal prison, located on Alcatraz Island 
    in San Francisco bay that closed in 1963. It has been decided that a triathlon 
    between these two nefarious prisons would be a challenge for those who enjoy a 
    challenge and attract history buffs as well. This particular race will be near 
    Half Ironman, consisting of: a run of roughly 16 miles, a challenging swim of 3 
    miles and a scenic cycling course of 25 miles. The cost to enter is $100. The race 
    will begin near San Quentin, run to Fisherman's wharf, swim to Alcatraz island and 
    back and then bike around San Francisco bay, crossing the John T. Knox freeway and 
    ending where the race began. This is a race between historic locales and unique in 
    its scope.  You don't want to miss out!!!</p>
