		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name's Jeremy, and if your viewing this page you're most likely interested in what I would have to offer 
                as a potential Employee.  I've worked for many years in many different fields that have given me a working 
                of several things.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Computers are fun.  If I were to say my most experienced field it would be in computers.  Since 
                I was about eight I've been the tech guy for my whole family.  Often my parents would ask me to fix the computers
                 within our home. I've managed networks, setup wireless printers with static IPs, and even built a website, all 
                 before an formal education.  Currently I'm working on a degree in Computer Information Technology and expect to 
                 graduate in August of 2015.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Music is a passion of mine.  I've been writing and playing music for over Ten years.  I started out
                 playing the recorder, as most do, but I wanted to play the trumpet.  As soon as I could I picked it up and 
                 joined the school Jazz band.  I went on to excel getting into bands in Tokyo, Japan, Brussels, Belgium, and 
                 even Germany.  I eventually picked up the guitar, the piano, got some vocal training, and started writing.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third and finally, I'm a Swing Dancer.  Lindy Hop, East Coast, and Balboa are what I like best.  I have been 
                dancing for almost four years now.  Of those four years I've been instructing for three and a half.  I caught 
                onto swing dancing very fast, and enjoy Balboa the best.  If you want lessons my rates are good and i'm just 
                a contact form away.
