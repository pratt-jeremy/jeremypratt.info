    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> I am originally from Heidelberg,
                Germany where i lived for almost 20 years.  I currently live in San Antonio with my wife and son and am working
                on a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Technology.  My main goals in the next 5 years are to 
                graduate with said degree and get a job doing front-end development either in web application development
                or mobile development.</p>
